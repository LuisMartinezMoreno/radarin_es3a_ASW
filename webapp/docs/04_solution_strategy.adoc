== Solution Strategy


=== Backend

.Solid-file-client:
We will use this library to interchange information from POD and github. It works with json archives.

.Inrupt-javascript-libraries:
The libraries for the usage of the PODs, it is the union between the solid code and the POD storage.
.Solid:
It will be the core of the backend, everything will be managed using the SOLID principles.

.NodeMailer API:
This API will allow us to implement emails as a way of notificate the users

.Firebase Cloud Messaging API:
This API will allow us to have real time notifications, also a notification center for the user to see what he missed

.MongoDB
This will manage the database.

.MongoDB Atlas
It is a server of mongoDB, so the app will be able to get the informatiuon of the user wherever he is.

=== Frontend
.React-bootstrap:
We will use this technology to make the designs, the UI.
.GoogleMapsAPI:
This API will simplify a lot the location and ubication requirements of the project.
.React components
For the implementation of the interface



=== Developer Tools
.Github managers:
To simplify the usage of the github platform and avoid possible problems. Some people of the team use the native solution from github, github desktop, and some others use GitKraken, a third-party alternative

.VSCode: 
To develop the code.

.Docker app
The docker app configures the system to work with the docker environment.

.XCode
For the develop of the iOS app

.Android Studio
For the develop of the Andoid app


=== How are going to be reached the non fuctional requirements?
.Privacy:
The users' location will only be stored while the user is connected.
The essential information will be stored in SOLID PODs providing a strong privacy.

.Usability:
The interfaces will be intuitives and easy to use.

.Performance:
The performance will be smooth, by using technologies that improve it.

.Testability:
The app will be tested manually and automatically
